<p align="center"> I live in the outer east suburbs of Victoria. I have two children, 11 and 9 and two dogs just over a year old. They are a rottwieler and a german shepherd. I worked as a disability carer for 18 years but have now injured myself and am not working. I like to read and really love watching zombie tv shows and movies. </p>


<p align="center" "> I have always had an interest in IT since year 12, where I completed year 11 and 12 IT while I was still in year 10. I should have really listened to my Dad when he told me to stick with IT when I was 18. Lesson learned!!! 
Computers have always been a big part of my life. We had an old apple mac in our house when I was young and I learned to type on it. The typing game and one other were the only games that were available on the mac so there wasn’t much to choose from. 
I am completing two subjects with RMIT through open universities this year, Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming. I am hoping to get into a Bachelor of cyber security/Criminology next year.</p>


<p style="text-align:center; color:black;”> My ideal job would be a crime analyst.</p>

<p > A crime analyst conducts research and analizes data looking for patterns of crime. The collaborate with local law enforcement and provides statistics and reports.</p>

<p> Communication, and time-management skills are a must for this role, as is the ability to learn and generate reports. Being trustworthy and a being able to work in a team is also very important.</p>
<p> I would need to have a Criminology degree or similar and start in a lesser role as opposed to manager. </p>
<p> I find this type of job appealing as I have an eye for detail and I like things to be logical. I would like to be able to assist in stopping crimes before they are committed not after the fact. </p>

<p style="color:green;"> I already have good communication skills and life experience, I could still learn a lot more though. As I said earlier I plan on obtaining a Bachelor in cyber security/criminology so I have the education as well. </p>

<p> My learning styles and personality traits don't come as a surprise to me ; I learn visually, kinesthetically and auditorily. It helps that I can learn from all three as not all teaching is the same and I can pick up most things however they are taught. </p>
<p> My personality was fairly similar in that my openness, conscientiouness, extraversion and agreeableness are all similar in there percentage of my personality. It makes me able to take all things into considerations and be able to see everyones point of view even if it differs from my own, which really helps when working in a team. I can be assertive enough to put forward my ideas but also be able to take on board other ideas. </p>
