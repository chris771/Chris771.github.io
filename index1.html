<p> My learning styles and personality traits don't come as a surprise to me ; I learn visually, kinesthetically and auditorily. It helps that I can learn from all three as not all teaching is the same and I can pick up most things however they are taught. </p>
<p> My personality was fairly similar in that my openness, conscientiouness, extraversion and agreeableness are all similar in there percentage of my personality. It makes me able to take all things into considerations and be able to see everyones point of view even if it differs from my own, which really helps when working in a team. I can be assertive enough to put forward my ideas but also be able to take on board other ideas. </p>
